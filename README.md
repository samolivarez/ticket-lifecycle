This osTicket Lifecycle tutorial begins with our created user "Karen Karen" going to the osTicket Support Center page to prepare to open a new ticket. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
Next, we see the user "Karen Karen" go to the "Open a new Ticket" page to create a "Business Critical Outage" ticket with Issue Summary of "entire mobile online banking down" with note "customers getting 404 error" *As a reminder this ticket lifecycle example is merely a mock real-world ticket example that was created by our own created "user" named "Karen Karen" in order to simulate a possible real-world ticketing system experience.

<p>
Next, working from our osTicket "Jane's" agent panel we see the ticket created by our user "Karen "Karen" with the subject "entire mobile online banking down" with default priority status of "normal".

</p>
<p>
Next, the above image shows how the ticket status has been changed from the default "normal" status to the more appropriate ticket priority status of "Emergency" with the added note of "business impacting event" as having entire mobile online banking system down is a "Business Critical Outage" that impacts business.

<p>
Next, the above image shows how the ticket has been upgraded to SLA Level "SEV-A" which is the highest SLA ticket priority status which sets the ticket resolution timeframe of 1 hour 24/7.

<p>
Next, the above image shows how the ticket has been transferred to our previously created "System Administration" department as this type of ticket is usually beyond the scope of help desk.
